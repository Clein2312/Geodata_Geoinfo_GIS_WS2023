# Database Nomalization #

My presentation for this topic is not open, yet. Students of HSRW can download it from the related Moodle course.

In the presentation the database for the fictive "For Ladies" sales company is discussed. The spreadsheet "For_Ladies_DB_Normalization_V001.xlsx" in the repo shows the decomposition (normalization) of the initial relation. 
 
The music database example of the presentation can be created by the sql script [070_create_and_fill_music_db_with_music_user_V001.sql](./sql_scripts/script/070_create_and_fill_music_db_with_music_user_V001.sql) in the folder sql_scripts.
